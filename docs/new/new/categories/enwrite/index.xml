 Iâ€™m so proud (and of course posting this from Evernote using the web clipper)Â ðŸ˜ƒ Enwrite â‡’ Evernote-powered statically-generated blogs and websites.
Post from the Evernote application on any device, use the web clipper, or post by email. Enwrite will pick up the new content and post it automaticallyâ€¦
 As well as turning new notes into weblog posts, you can use Enwrite to convert the contents of existing Evernote notebooks into a static site, using search terms and tags to select notes for publication.</description>
