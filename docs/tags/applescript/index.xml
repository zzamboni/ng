      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to fix the breakage caused by one of the recent updates to
Microsoft Outlook in the Outlook-to-OmniFocus AppleScript included
with my SendToOmniFocus spoon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Find all single-note tags in Evernote</title>

      <description>I’ve been working on cleaning up my Evernote, and noticed that I have a lot of tags assigned to a single note. I had successfully used Veritrope’s excellent Evernote empty tag remover applescript, so I made some small changes to write the attached script, which will find all single-note tags in your Evernote and list them in a new note, including links to each note. This makes it much easier to go through them and see which of those tags could be removed.</description>

      <title>Airmail tip: prevent &#34;Save to Evernote&#34; action from opening the created note</title>

      <description>I’ve been trying out Airmail as my main email app. It’s quite nice, I like the built-in integrations, particularly with Evernote. By default, when you use the “Save to Evernote” action, it saves the current message to Evernote and opens the newly-created note. I went spelunking into the Airmail application directory, and found the way to disable the note-opening. Follow these steps:   Quit Airmail (don’t know if this is necessary, but it can’t hurt) Open the Terminal app Run the following command in the terminal (all in a single line): sudo /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript\ Editor.</description>
