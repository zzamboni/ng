 Looks positively old-fashioned now, but the memories! I don’t remember this particular page, but I do remember compiling and using Mosaic as my first web browser on an old DECstation 5000, my first Unix workstation.    </description>

      <description>I just finished upgrading our Mac (my wife and I share it) to Lion. It looks very nice. This has been the OS X upgrade to which I have given less thought: purchase, download, backup, install, done.
 I think a lot of this has to do with the online distribution. We are used to installing things downloaded from the Internet without much thought (of course there are security considerations, but that&#39;s another topic).</description>
