      <title>Overhauling my GTD system under Windows</title>

      <description>As you may know, I&#39;m a reluctant switcher from Mac to Windows. I am also a fan of GTD. I had been using Jello Dashboard (JD) to implement GTD under Outlook. JD is a very nice system, the developer is friendly and responsive, and I had even written several patches to adapt it to my way of working. I was even in the process of drafting a series of blog posts titled &#34;</description>

      <description>I got latex2html to install on the latest cygwin, however to get the configure to pass I had to alter the configure to recognize cygwin as a UNIX. via mail-archive.com  Using this patch I was able to properly configure and install latex2html under cygwin in Windows 7.

      <title>LogParser, Event Logs, and Vista - Neil Carpenter&#39;s Blog - Site Home - TechNet Blogs</title>

      <description>The only workaround to this is to convert the logfile to the new evtx format prior to parsing it. You can do this in the event log viewer GUI by doing a Save As... but I find it easier to do this at the command prompt: wevtutil epl application.evt application.evtx /lf:true
  via blogs.technet.com  I&#39;m trying to process Windows Event Viewer files (.evt) from some servers on my Win7 machine, which kept me giving a &#34;</description>

      <title>Setting up a global hotkey to add tasks to Outlook</title>

      <description>One thing I missed since I moved from a Mac (using The Hit List for GTD) to Outlook (using Jello Dashboard for GTD) was the availability of a global hot key that I could use to bring up a text entry box which I could use to quickly add things into my electronic Inbox, for later processing.
I have found a way to achieve this, and here is the setup I am using now:</description>

      <title>Making cygwin, Windows and emacs understand the same symlinks</title>
      <link>http://zzamboni.org/post/making-cygwin-windows-and-emacs-understand-the-same-symlinks/</link>

      <guid>http://zzamboni.org/post/making-cygwin-windows-and-emacs-understand-the-same-symlinks/</guid>
      <description>Today I ran into the problem that symlinks created under cygwin using &#34;ln -s&#34; are not understood by Windows, and of course Windows shortcuts are seen by cygwin as regular files. Happily, this is a (semi-)solved problem. For reference, this is what needs to be done:

 Add &#34;winsymlinks&#34; to your CYGWIN environment variable. For example, in my .bashrc I have the following:
export CYGWIN=&#34;nodosfilewarning winsymlinks&#34;

This makes cygwin create symlinks differently, in a form that is understood both by it and by Windows.</description>

      <description>One of the most useful applications I have discovered since I had to switch to Windows as my main OS is OneNote, a really great note-taking application which I use for pretty much every data-storing and note-taking need. I use a OneNote notebook as part of my GTD inbox. Today&#39;s very simple tip is how to assign a keystroke for opening my Inbox notebook from anywhere in the system. Here are the steps:</description>

      <guid>http://zzamboni.org/post/installing-cfengine-on-windows-7-under-cygwin/</guid>
      <description>Update (2011/09/05): Updated the instructions for cfengine 3.2.0, cygwin 1.7.9, and tested them on a clean cygwin install.
Installing the cfengine community edition under Windows (the commercial version includes native Windows support) is fairly easy under cygwin, you just need to have the appropriate dependencies installed. Here’s how I did it.
Versions 
 cfengine: 3.2.0  Windows 7 Enterprise SP1/64bit cygwin: 1.7.9-1   Additional cygwin packages needed To install these, run cygwin’s setup.</description>

      <title>Installing AucTeX on EmacsW32 on Win7/64bit</title>

      <description>Today I had to install AucTeX to use on my Win7/64 machine under EmacsW32. I found the basic instructions here: http://www.sturmnet.org/blog/2007/09/01/installing-auctex-in-emacsw32, but I had to modify them a bit (in particular, I am using tetex installed from cygwin instead of MiKTeX). Here are the commands I used:
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/share/texmf
$ ./configure --prefix=&#39;c:/Program Files (x86)/Emacs/emacs&#39; --with-texmf-dir=&#39;/usr/local/share/texmf&#39; --with-lispdir=&#39;c:/Program Files (x86)/Emacs/emacs/site-lisp&#39;
$ make
$ make install
I then added the following lines to my C:\Program Files (x86)\Emacs\site-lisp\site-start.</description>

      <description>I recently had to copy a very large file (&amp;gt;4GB) from a remote Windows share to my Windows 7 machine, over a very finicky connection (frequently-failing VPN over a slow Internet connection). A GUI copy didn&#39;t work because the connection dropped frequently. I tried Free Download Manager, which was the recommended tool for the download, but surprisingly, it wasn&#39;t always able to restart the download after connectivity dropped.
Then a colleague pointed me to the &#34;</description>

      <description>I am not just a Linux enthusiast, I also happen to use Windows quite often. In fact, Windows is my primary desktop from which I connect to all the other boxes and do my work on. During the years of Windows usage, I have accumulated a list of must-have Windows programs that I wouldn’t be able to work without. Some of them are commercial, some are freeware, but that doesn’t matter.</description>
