      <description>I have been blogging about CFEngine here for a while (it&#39;s my most frequent tag). As of now, I&#39;m starting to post all CFEngine-related posts to http://blog.cf-learn.info/, which is part of the web site for my book &#34;Learning CFEngine 3&#34;. In this way, I intend to group all CFEngine-related content over there. I will still cross-post relevant things here, but if you want to stay fully up to date on my CFEngine writings, please subscribe over there as well.</description>
