      <description>Whenever you look at a firewall rule, half the time you’re going to be asking yourself, “Why is that there? Did *I* put it there? Do we still need it?” It would sure be nice if the explanation were right there, as a comment that could be version-tracked, exported into nice reports, searched on, and placed in a standard format that would be compatible with other exception entries in other tools.</description>

      <description>I am rugged - and more importantly, my code is rugged.  I recognize that software has become a foundation of our modern world.
I recognize the awesome responsibility that comes with this foundational role.
I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate, in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever intended.
I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and national security.</description>
