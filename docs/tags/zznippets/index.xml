 Interesting article. I hadn’t heard of Fluentd, looks useful.   The old paradigm — machines to humans, and the new — machines to machines. Image courtesy of Kiyoto Tamura.   Over the last decade, the primary consumer of log data shifted from humans to machines.  Software engineers still read logs, especially when their software behaves in an unexpected manner. However, in terms of “bytes processed,” humans account for a tiny fraction of the total consumption.</description>

Nice essay.But then, finally, with one last branch hacked from your way, you set eyes upon it, and stand there. Silent and still. Perhaps you raise a hand, feeling time-worn stone beneath your fingertips. A dream, finally made solid. You’ve come so far, and now, at last, you’re here. </description>

      <description> You’re probably using the wrong dictionary « the jsomers.net blog  &amp;gt; Which is to say you get a feeling about English that Calvin once got with his pet tiger on a day of fresh-fallen snow: “It’s a magical world, Hobbes. Let’s go exploring!”  Very nice article. I ended up using the package from this page, which has slightly-better formatting in my opinion.  </description>

      <description>Another great article by Matt Gemmell. I knew most of them, but learned a few things. The golden part for me were the third-party utilities, in particular Shortcat, which I didn’t know and is amazing:  &amp;gt; It’s basically Spotlight but for all visible controls and objects on the screen: it’s type-to-select for *everything you can see*.   The whole article is worth a read.  </description>

      <description>Great article.  I’ve been working from home full-time for more than seven years, and running my own business for the same amount of time. Many of us at least have the opportunity to occasionally work from home, and I daresay that many people would like the chance to do so permanently. It’s not just as straightforward as pulling out a laptop in the living room, though. Working from home has a number of difficulties and challenges.</description>

      <description>Interesting explanation, via http://ralfmaximus.tumblr.com/post/73635353732/spinningyarns-doctorbee-xwidep-scales   This is because Fahrenheit is based on a brine scale and the human body. The scale is basically how cold does it have to be to freeze saltwater (zero Fahrenheit) to what temperature is the human body (100-ish Fahrenheit, although now we know that’s not exactly accurate). Fahrenheit was designed around humans.  Celsius and Kelvin are designed around the natural world.  Celsius is a scale based on water.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m giving an Ignite talk for the first time at DevOps days Paris. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting format: a 5-minute talk with 20 auto-advancing slides, every 15 seconds. I found How to Give a great Ignite Talk by Scott Berkun very useful, including the accompanying video.

      <description>At 16:02 UTC, Friday, May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon officially became the first privately-owned commercial spacecraft to be captured by and berthed at the International Space Station. It is (if I’ve done the math correctly) the 114th spacecraft to dock with ISS, including the missions sent up to build the station. It is the first privately-owned commercial spacecraft in history to do so.

   The story is simple: A bunch of black rats almost wiped out a bunch of gigantic bugs on a little island far, far away from most of us. A few dedicated scientists, passionate about biological diversity, risked their lives to keep the bugs going. For the bugs to get their homes and their future back doesn&#39;t depend on scientists anymore. They&#39;ve done their job. Now it&#39;s up to the folks on Lord Howe Island.</description>

      <description>COMMANDMENTS
 Work on one thing at a time until finished. Start no more new books, add no more new material to &#34;Black Spring.&#34; Don&#39;t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand. Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time! When you can&#39;t create you can work. Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers. Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.</description>

&#39;git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/the/formerly/misbehaving/module&#39;
 via ignoredbydinosaurs.com  I accidentally added another git repository to a git-svn repository, which makes it die when trying to push the changes. This technique helped me fix it. Documenting mostly so I remember when it happens again sometime.

      <description>nwdiag generates network-diagram image file from .diag file. .diag file is similar to DOT file (graphviz’s).
You can get diagrams like this.
 blockdiag.com via @saintaardvark  Very useful, like Graphviz but specifically for network diagrams. You can probably obtain the same result with Graphviz with the appropriate amount of dot magic, but nwdiag makes this very easy. Other useful graph types in sister projects: http://blockdiag.com/en/index.html

      <description>the man sitting next to me was reading proprietary information, information that could be very, very damaging to this company if in the wrong hands, and he couldn’t have cared less about it via shankman.com  Fascinating, scary story. It&#39;s amazing the things people do in airplanes (particularly on their laptops/iPads/phones) as if no one was watching them. Situational awareness is very important.

      <title>Fraser Speirs - Blog - Misconceptions About iOS Multitasking</title>
      <link>https://zzamboni.org/post/fraser-speirs---blog---misconceptions-about-iosmultitasking/</link>

      <guid>https://zzamboni.org/post/fraser-speirs---blog---misconceptions-about-iosmultitasking/</guid>
      <description>Let me wrap this up by giving you a quick summary:
 If someone tells you that all the apps in the multitasking bar are running, using up memory or sucking power, they are wrong. When you hit the home button, an app moves from Active to Background and quickly to the Suspended state where it no longer uses CPU time or drains power. An app may request an additional 10 minutes of Background running to complete a big task before becoming Suspended.</description>

 They can also do ball jugling:

 Have precise movement control:

      <description>Follow mode is a minor mode that makes two windows, both showing the same buffer, scroll as a single tall “virtual window.” To use Follow mode, go to a frame with just one window, split it into two side-by-side windows using C-x 3, and then type M-x follow-mode. From then on, you can edit the buffer in either of the two windows, or scroll either one; the other window follows it.</description>

      <description>I hate this game. I hate it so much. I don’t want to play it. I hate playing it. I don’t enjoy playing it. But every day [...] I play it. I cry and I throw a tantrum and I complain and I hate it so much, but I play it.
Go to hell, Andreas Illiger. You rich, genius son of a bitch.

      <description>This time i’m going to talk about the basic components that make up a physics engine and how to put them together; this tutorial is aimed at programmers who have a basic grasp of maths and geometry but would like to step into the world of simulation.
It is my hope that if, at the beginning of this article, you are able to code the physics behind the 1972 game Pong, by the end of the article you will be equally happy writing your own constraints to use in your own physics solver!</description>

      <guid>https://zzamboni.org/post/how-to-digitally-sign-a-macro-project---outlook/</guid>
      <description>This article explains how you can digitally sign a file or a macro project by using a certificate. If you don&#39;t already have a digital certificate, you must obtain one. To test macro projects on your own computer, you can create your own self-signing certificate by using the Selfcert.exe tool.
 via office.microsoft.com  Useful for future reference. I&#39;m playing with a bit of VBA in Outlook, and found that my code would work fine right after writing it, but if I restart Outlook, the macros will be disabled unless I first sign them as described in this article.</description>

There&#39;s a lot of you in Watson.&#34; I understood then why the engineers wanted to beat me so badly: To them, I wasn&#39;t the good guy, playing for the human race. That was Watson&#39;s role, as a symbol and product of human innovation and ingenuity.</description>

Writes Jaime:
The idea behind the video is Pac Man&#39;s final days, free from the maze (kudos if you can guess who&#39;s castle that is) and eating pellets to his heart&#39;s content in a glowing pellet forest. His dead, bloated body is found afterwards and then delivered to 8-Bit Labs.</description>

Read their work out loud.    via ragan.com  Worth reading the full article.

      <description>A person&#39;s own name is the single most important word to him/her; it is intimately tied to his/her identity as an individual. How you deal with people&#39;s names can have a profound effect on their impressions of you: Think about the times you&#39;ve felt special when someone you admired addressed you by your name in a sincere tone; or think about the times when you&#39;ve felt belittled when someone negligently called you by the wrong name, or worse, maliciously made fun of your name in front of you.</description>

      <description>The US Chamber of Commerce has apparently spent too much time watching Mad Men: in a blog post this morning, Chamber blogger Brad Peck called women’s fight for pay equity to be nothing more than a “fetish for money,” and said women complaining about their pay should focus instead on “choosing the right partner at home.” via workinprogress.firedoglake.com  You couldn&#39;t make up stuff like this.

      <guid>https://zzamboni.org/post/10-big-ideas-from-gtd/</guid>
      <description>Here are 10 big ideas from David Allen’s Getting Things Done…
1. If your day-to-day life is out of control, it’s almost impossible to think strategically or plan effectively. 2. Define what being “done” looks like.
3. Mental work has five distinct phases: Collect, Process, Organize, Do, and Review
4. Get everything out of your head.
5. Projects and tasks are two different things: track them separately.
6. Focus on the Next Action required to move forward.</description>

      <description>You walk into a clothing store and see what is probably the most bad ass leather jacket you’ve ever seen.
You try it on, look in the mirror and decide you must have it. While wearing this item, you imagine onlookers will clutch their chests and gasp every time you walk into a room or cross a street. You lift the sleeve to check the price – $1,000.
Well, that’s that, you think.</description>

      <description>of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult. In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening (source: CDC). Drowning does not look like drowning via mariovittone.com  This is an eye-opening article for me. Not having actually watched anyone drown (fortunately), I had the impression that someone drowning would trash madly as shown on TV and movies.</description>

      <description>It is common in fiction for the bad guys to lose and the good guys to win.
It’s how you would like to see the world- just and fair.
In psychology, the tendency to believe this is how the real world actually works is called the Just-World Fallacy.
More specifically, this is the tendency to react to horrible misfortune, like homelessness or drug addiction, by believing the people stuck in horrible situations must have done something to deserve it.</description>

The bank doesn&#39;t make pizza, and we don&#39;t take checks.&#34;&#34;If you would like to use your plate for your cigarette ashes, please ask the waiter to serve your pizza in the ashtray&#34;</description>

During the years of Windows usage, I have accumulated a list of must-have Windows programs that I wouldn’t be able to work without. Some of them are commercial, some are freeware, but that doesn’t matter.</description>

      <description>Israelis, unlike Canadians and Americans, don&#39;t take s--- from anybody. When the security agency in Israel (the ISA) started to tighten security and we had to wait in line for — not for hours — but 30 or 40 minutes, all hell broke loose here. We said, &#39;We&#39;re not going to do this. You&#39;re going to find a way that will take care of security without touching the efficiency of the airport.</description>

      <description>First off, credit for this fix goes to Geoff Watts from his two tweets.
If you’re using Snow Leopard, you’ll find that the current version of MacFusion refuses to complete a connection to a remote server. You can fix this in two steps:
First, quit MacFusion.
Second, open System Preferences and then open the MacFUSE pane. Check the “Show Beta Versions” box and click “Check For Updates”. Go ahead and update MacFUSE.</description>

      <description>For one of my projects at work, I am using a test install of RHEL5 in &#34;workstation&#34; mode, but I needed to install some packages that are only available in the &#34;server&#34; package list. To temporarily make yum search the server repositories, just change the following line in /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date: 
versionOverride=5Server 
(normally the value is empty). </description>

The latest beta release (2.8.3.BETA-11) introduces a new keychain format that, among other things, allows 1Password to detect changes made to the file by other programs and reload the changes on the fly. I am using this now to keep my 1P data synchronized between my work and personal accounts on my machine. Here&#39;s what I did:
 In my work account (dza), switch to the AgileKeyChain format by following the instructions.</description>

It should also auto-post to Flickr, so here goes a test photo.
