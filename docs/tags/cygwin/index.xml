      <description>I got latex2html to install on the latest cygwin, however to get the configure to pass I had to alter the configure to recognize cygwin as a UNIX. via mail-archive.com  Using this patch I was able to properly configure and install latex2html under cygwin in Windows 7.

      <title>Making cygwin, Windows and emacs understand the same symlinks</title>

      <description>Today I ran into the problem that symlinks created under cygwin using &#34;ln -s&#34; are not understood by Windows, and of course Windows shortcuts are seen by cygwin as regular files. Happily, this is a (semi-)solved problem. For reference, this is what needs to be done:

 Add &#34;winsymlinks&#34; to your CYGWIN environment variable. For example, in my .bashrc I have the following:
export CYGWIN=&#34;nodosfilewarning winsymlinks&#34;

This makes cygwin create symlinks differently, in a form that is understood both by it and by Windows.</description>

      <title>Installing cfengine on Windows 7 under cygwin</title>

      <description>Update (2011/09/05): Updated the instructions for cfengine 3.2.0, cygwin 1.7.9, and tested them on a clean cygwin install.
Installing the cfengine community edition under Windows (the commercial version includes native Windows support) is fairly easy under cygwin, you just need to have the appropriate dependencies installed. Here’s how I did it.
Versions 
 cfengine: 3.2.0  Windows 7 Enterprise SP1/64bit cygwin: 1.7.9-1   Additional cygwin packages needed To install these, run cygwin’s setup.</description>
