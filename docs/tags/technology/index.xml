      <description>When I arrived in Switzerland nine years ago I didn&#39;t speak a word of German (much less Swiss German!), so for a while I faced a very real and practical problem. I would encounter signs on the street, and have absolutely no idea what they meant. Does this sign mean I can pass, or I cannot? &#34;Watch your step&#34; or &#34;Watch for the vicious dog&#34;? During that period, I often wished for a gadget that I could point at the sign and would give me an instant translation.</description>
