      <description>Iâ€™m doing some cleanup and reorganization, and captured my current app setup as a reference point. Here they are.
Quick note: The first screen is my most-used apps (some are going out now, like 2Do which I&#39;ve never liked too much, but was the best way to sync tasks with Outlook, which I&#39;m no longer forced using). Second screen is all my folders. Third and fourth screens are my girls&#39; screens, with the games they use when they borrow my phone.</description>
