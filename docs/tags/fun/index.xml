      <description>Google has launched a new labs project called Google Scribe, which essentially provides an auto-completion service. You type, it autocompletes. The following text was generated by typing a single space, and from then on simply accepting the default suggestions (pressing &#34;Enter&#34; every time the suggestion popup appeared). I had to stop at some point, but it seems like a good source of mindless entertainment. Also, the result varies depending on the initial seed word you provide, and also on whether you just accept blindly (Enter) or type spaces at certain places.</description>
