      <description>Today I have two big announcements to make.
First, as of this week I have a new job, I am now working with CFEngine AS, the company that develops and maintains cfengine. As you know if you read my blog, I am a big fan of cfengine. It is a mature and able tool that provides extreme flexibility and power to system administrators. The company is full of energy and with very interesting projects to make cfengine even better and more popular than it is today.</description>

      <description>Thirteen years ago, I left Mexico to study a Ph.D. in the U.S. In the meantime, apart from doing that, I got married, we moved to Switzerland, and we formed a beautiful family. I have learned so many things, I have changed in so many ways. In the words of my advisor, during one of our very early email exchanges, before I went to Purdue:
It isn&#39;t so much a leaving as a beginning of something else.</description>
