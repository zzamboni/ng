      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for new toys, particularly if they make my work more productive or enjoyable. For a couple of months now I have been using a new Unix shell called Elvish as my default login shell on macOS, and I love it. It‚Äôs a young project but very usable and with some very nice features.
Here are a few of the things I like about it:
 The Elvish language is clean and powerful, with clear syntax.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this second article about Hammerspoon, we look into &lt;em&gt;Spoons&lt;/em&gt;,
modules written in Lua which can be easily installed and loaded into
Hammerspoon to provide ready-to-use functionality. Spoons provide a
predefined API to configure and use them. They are also a good way to
share your own work with other users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was planning the reboot of my website, I seriously considered using Ghost. It has a very nice UI, beautiful and usable theme out of the box, and a very active community. Eventually I decided to use Hugo, but in the process discovered that it is possible to host a statically-generated Ghost website using GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

 https://medium.com/@mrdoro/fast-translation-with-google-translator-and-mac-osx-817e32233b7a  Nice article about how to create a service to automatically translate selected text from any application. I use this all the time, I have a ‚ÄúGerman-to-English‚Äù service bound to Command-Alt-Ctrl-Shift-E, so I can just select text off the screen, press the shortcut, and a window with the translation will pop up. Very handy.   </description>

Post from the Evernote application on any device, use the web clipper, or post by email. Enwrite will pick up the new content and post it automatically‚Ä¶
 As well as turning new notes into weblog posts, you can use Enwrite to convert the contents of existing Evernote notebooks into a static site, using search terms and tags to select notes for publication.</description>

 This is probably old news for most, but it still blew my mind: only now I realized that the clicking feeling and sound on my MacBook Pro‚Äôs trackpad is artificially generated. I did the experiment of turning on ‚ÄúSilent clicking‚Äù and turning off ‚ÄúForce click and haptic feedback‚Äù on the trackpad preferences panel and, indeed, the clicking is gone. Wow (/ht¬†@jsnell)  To aid in the process, the Magic Trackpad apparently even generates its own artificial clicking noise (as the Force Touch trackpads in the MacBook and MacBook Pro do).</description>

      <description>via http://www.freshblurbs.com/blog/2013/06/22/github-multiple-ssh-keys.html#tldr
 Since Github doesn&#39;t allow us to reuse an SSH Key, the only sane solution is to jump through some hoops and generate + use multiple keys on the server itself. Let&#39;s look at some effective approaches of doing that.  Short version: define multiple hosts in the SSH config file for each repository, which use different SSH keys, then you can assign different deploy keys to each repo.</description>

      <description>I started getting errors from the TRAMP Emacs package because I was using fish as my default shell, and it does not recognize certain standard syntax elements (such as &amp;amp;&amp;amp; to separate commands), and Emacs runs subcommands under the default shell. I fixed this by:
 Changing my account&#39;s default shell back to `/bin/bash` Changing my Terminal.app preferences to run `/usr/local/bin/fish` when a shell opens, instead of the default login shell:  Log out and back in to have everything reloaded properly.</description>

 Interesting article. I hadn‚Äôt heard of Fluentd, looks useful.   The old paradigm ‚Äî machines to humans, and the new ‚Äî machines to machines. Image courtesy of Kiyoto Tamura.   Over the last decade, the primary consumer of log data shifted from humans to machines.  Software engineers still read logs, especially when their software behaves in an unexpected manner. However, in terms of ‚Äúbytes processed,‚Äù humans account for a tiny fraction of the total consumption.</description>

      <description>I needed to copy a directory between two git repositories while preserving its history. I found some good instructions at http://gbayer.com/development/moving-files-from-one-git-repository-to-another-preserving-history/, which got me started, but I figured out a way to avoid having to move all the files into their directory again (lines 5-6 in Greg&amp;rsquo;s instructions) by reversing the filter to remove everything I don&amp;rsquo;t want instead of only including the directory I want. Here are the steps (the idea is the same as in Greg&amp;rsquo;s post, so please read that to get the explanation, I&amp;rsquo;m only listing the commands here for reference):</description>

 Useful note about how to poll an Evernote account¬†for new content. Also a test of web clipping with Enwrite. Polling If your app wants to know about changes in a user&#39;s Evernote account, you&#39;ll probably consider calling the NoteStore.findNotesMetadata function periodically to search for new notes. findNotes is incredibly powerful, but it&#39;s also expensive for our servers - we need to load the user&#39;s Lucene index, perform the search across all of their notes, hit the database to pull out the results, and send those results over the network to your app.</description>

Let‚Äôs go exploring!‚Äù  Very nice article. I ended up using the package from this page, which has slightly-better formatting in my opinion.  </description>

      <description>Another great article¬†by Matt Gemmell. I knew most of them, but learned a few things. The golden part for me were the third-party utilities, in particular¬†Shortcat, which I didn‚Äôt know and is amazing:  &amp;gt;¬†It‚Äôs basically Spotlight but for all visible controls and objects on the screen: it‚Äôs type-to-select for *everything you can see*.   The whole article is worth a read.  </description>

      <description>If you are using docker on Mac OS X using boot2docker (http://docs.docker.io/installation/mac/), you may see truncated output from docker run, and also may have noticed that docker attach does not work properly, producing only some output and then exiting. This bug is documented here: https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/150, where I also found the following workaround. Documenting it here in case anyone finds it useful:
Instead of using the default value of DOCKER_HOST provided by boot2docker up, establish the docker connection through an ssh tunnel:</description>

      <description>Great article.  I‚Äôve been working from home full-time for more than seven years, and running my own business for the same amount of time. Many of us at least have the opportunity to occasionally work from home, and I daresay that many people would like the chance to do so permanently. It‚Äôs not just as straightforward as pulling out a laptop in the living room, though. Working from home has a number of difficulties and challenges.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been trying out¬†Airmail¬†as my main email app. It‚Äôs quite nice, I like the built-in integrations, particularly with Evernote. By default, when you use the ‚ÄúSave to Evernote‚Äù action, it saves the current message to Evernote and opens the newly-created note. I went spelunking into the Airmail application directory, and found the way to disable the note-opening. Follow these steps:   Quit Airmail (don‚Äôt know if this is necessary, but it can‚Äôt hurt) Open the Terminal app Run the following command in the terminal (all in a single line): sudo /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript\ Editor.</description>

I just learned the solution (from¬†http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1651662): remove BusyCal 1.6 (I upgraded to BusyCal 2, but left the old version around in case I had to go back to it). After removing it and restarting the Dock, the problem stopped.  From the same thread, it seems the problem was caused by BusyCal‚Äôs ‚Äúanimate transitions‚Äù preference.</description>

      <description>Interesting explanation, via¬†http://ralfmaximus.tumblr.com/post/73635353732/spinningyarns-doctorbee-xwidep-scales   This is because Fahrenheit is based on a brine scale and the human body. The scale is basically how cold does it have to be to freeze saltwater (zero Fahrenheit) to what temperature is the human body (100-ish Fahrenheit, although now we know that‚Äôs not exactly accurate). Fahrenheit was designed around humans.  Celsius and Kelvin are designed around the natural world.  Celsius is a scale based on water.</description>

      <description>Evernote introduced some time ago an &#34;Insert Date&#34; keyboard shortcut, which is very handy. However, the options for the format of the inserted date seemed limited (only four options). I finally learned how this works, and how to change it on the Mac. The formats offered are those that are configured in the &#34;Languages &amp;amp; Text&#34; preferences panel. If you go to &#34;Region&#34; and then click the &#34;Customize button&#34; in the Dates part of the panel, you will see and be able to customize the formats for short, medium, long and full date representations.</description>

      <description>At 16:02 UTC, Friday, May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon officially became the first privately-owned commercial spacecraft to be captured by and berthed at the International Space Station. It is (if I‚Äôve done the math correctly) the 114th spacecraft to dock with ISS, including the missions sent up to build the station. It is the first privately-owned commercial spacecraft in history to do so.

   The story is simple: A bunch of black rats almost wiped out a bunch of gigantic bugs on a little island far, far away from most of us. A few dedicated scientists, passionate about biological diversity, risked their lives to keep the bugs going. For the bugs to get their homes and their future back doesn&#39;t depend on scientists anymore. They&#39;ve done their job. Now it&#39;s up to the folks on Lord Howe Island.</description>

 Work on one thing at a time until finished. Start no more new books, add no more new material to &#34;Black Spring.&#34; Don&#39;t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand. Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time! When you can&#39;t create you can work. Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers. Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.</description>

      <description>After using¬†Sparrow¬†for a while, I have decided to switch back to Mail.app. However, even after setting my default email client to Mail.app, all my message: links (for example, from messages dragged from Mail.app into¬†Things) were opening in Sparrow.
After some experimentation, I figured out what happened: I switched the default email client from Sparrow to Mail using Mail&#39;s preference panel: 
    
Apparently this switches the application for the mailto: protocol, but not for message:, nor for .</description>

      <title>How to remove a subproject/submodule to a git-svn repository</title>

      <guid>http://zzamboni.org/post/how-to-remove-a-subproject/submodule-to-a-git-svn-repository/</guid>
      <description>To sum up, you delete the offending directory and then run something to the effect of  git filter-branch --index-filter \
&#39;git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/the/formerly/misbehaving/module&#39;
 via ignoredbydinosaurs.com  I accidentally added another git repository to a git-svn repository, which makes it die when trying to push the changes. This technique helped me fix it. Documenting mostly so I remember when it happens again sometime.

      <description>nwdiag generates network-diagram image file from .diag file. .diag file is similar to DOT file (graphviz‚Äôs).
You can get diagrams like this.
 blockdiag.com¬†via @saintaardvark  Very useful, like Graphviz but specifically for network diagrams. You can probably obtain the same result with Graphviz with the appropriate amount of dot magic, but nwdiag makes this very easy. Other useful graph types in sister projects: http://blockdiag.com/en/index.html

      <description>Let me wrap this up by giving you a quick summary:
 If someone tells you that all the apps in the multitasking bar are running, using up memory or sucking power, they are wrong. When you hit the home button, an app moves from Active to Background and quickly to the Suspended state where it no longer uses CPU time or drains power. An app may request an additional 10 minutes of Background running to complete a big task before becoming Suspended.</description>

With this book, for the first time, I decided to conduct an experiment. I got the book as an audiobook (from Audible, playing on my iPhone), as an ebook (using Kindle on my iPhone) and also the hardcover physical book.</description>

Disk Utility reported everything was OK with the disk, but it still failed to mount. Upon poking a bit deeper, I found these messages in the logs:</description>

 They can also do ball jugling:

Quick note: The first screen is my most-used apps (some are going out now, like 2Do which I&#39;ve never liked too much, but was the best way to sync tasks with Outlook, which I&#39;m no longer forced using). Second screen is all my folders. Third and fourth screens are my girls&#39; screens, with the games they use when they borrow my phone.</description>

      <description>CFEngine is both the oldest and the newest of the popular tools for automating site administration. Mark Burgess invented it as a free software project in 1993, and years later, as deployments in the field outgrew its original design he gave it a complete rethink and developed the powerful concept of promise theory to make it modular and maintainable.via radar.oreilly.com  I contributed to this article by Andy Oram on CFEngine 3.</description>

First, as of this week I have a new job, I am now working with¬†CFEngine AS, the company that develops and maintains¬†cfengine. As you know if you read my blog, I am a big fan of cfengine. It is a mature and able tool that provides extreme flexibility and power to system administrators. The company is full of energy and with very interesting projects to make cfengine even better and more popular than it is today.</description>

Beautiful (and maybe not so hard to do - it&#39;s much like a dot-matrix printer, but printing from bottom up). I saw one of these a few years ago at the Motor Show in Geneva (at the Jeep stand), but it was much lower resolution and much less creative.

      <description>Cfengine¬†(tested 3.2.0)¬†installs easily on OS X (tested 10.7), given that it&#39;s Unix. One problem I encountered was that it does not compile with the bundled version of Berkeley DB (it recognizes it during configure, but produces compilation errors). The solution is to use some other DB engine. I chose Tokyo Cabinet. Using¬†homebrew, the process is simple
brew install tokyo-cabinet
After this, configure --with-tokyocabinet, and then compile and install as usual.</description>

      <description>Follow mode is a minor mode that makes two windows, both showing the same buffer, scroll as a single tall ‚Äúvirtual window.‚Äù To use Follow mode, go to a frame with just one window, split it into two side-by-side windows using C-x 3, and then type M-x follow-mode. From then on, you can edit the buffer in either of the two windows, or scroll either one; the other window follows it.</description>

      <description>I just finished upgrading our Mac (my wife and I share it) to Lion. It looks very nice.¬†This has been the OS X upgrade to which I have given less thought: purchase, download, backup, install, done.
 I think a lot of this has to do with the online distribution. We are used to installing things downloaded from the Internet without much thought (of course there are security considerations, but that&#39;s another topic).</description>

      <description>This time i‚Äôm going to talk about the basic components that make up a physics engine and how to put them together; this tutorial is aimed at programmers who have a basic grasp of maths and geometry but would like to step into the world of simulation.
It is my hope that if, at the beginning of this article, you are able to code the physics behind the 1972 game Pong, by the end of the article you will be equally happy writing your own constraints to use in your own physics solver!</description>

      <description>Please note:¬†I am no longer using Windows nor Outlook, so unfortunately I cannot offer any help with problems you encounter using these scripts and techniques.
Over the last few days I have been redoing my GTD-under-Outlook setup, based on the instructions available in the &#34;GTD and Outlook&#34; guide from DavidCo (I will write more about my setup later). One of the tricks the guide suggest is creating a mail rule on outgoing mail, which scans the message body for a special tag (/wf or *wf* are suggested) and automatically adds the message to the @WAITING FOR email folder.</description>

      <guid>http://zzamboni.org/post/how-to-digitally-sign-a-macro-project---outlook/</guid>
      <description>This article explains how you can digitally sign a file or a macro project by using a certificate. If you don&#39;t already have a digital certificate, you must obtain one. To test macro projects on your own computer, you can create your own self-signing certificate by using the Selfcert.exe tool.
 via office.microsoft.com  Useful for future reference. I&#39;m playing with a bit of VBA in Outlook, and found that my code would work fine right after writing it, but if I restart Outlook, the macros will be disabled unless I first sign them as described in this article.</description>

      <description>&#34;Watching you on Jeopardy! is what inspired the whole project,&#34; one IBM engineer told me, consolingly. &#34;And we looked at your games over and over, your style of play. There&#39;s a lot of you in Watson.&#34; I understood then why the engineers wanted to beat me so badly: To them, I wasn&#39;t the good guy, playing for the human race. That was Watson&#39;s role, as a symbol and product of human innovation and ingenuity.</description>

      <description>How do I use it?  Just draw the symbol you are looking for into the square area above and look what happens!
 via detexify.kirelabs.org  Fantastic tool. Draw a symbol, and it gives you suggestions for LaTeX symbols that match what you drew.

      <description>One thing I missed since I moved from a Mac (using The Hit List for GTD) to Outlook (using Jello Dashboard for GTD) was the availability of a global hot key that I could use to bring up a text entry box which I could use to quickly add things into my electronic Inbox, for later processing.
I have found a way to achieve this, and here is the setup I am using now:</description>

      <title>GTD tip: clean up physical clutter using ziploc bags</title>

      <description>If you are like me, you carry in your backpack, bag or briefcase all sorts of physical stuff, other than documents, papers or magazines. You know the type: phone chargers, USB cables, power adapters, network cables, USB sticks and other small gadgets or accessories. Over time these things accumulate and it becomes harder and harder to find them and to keep them organized. 
I have been using a low-tech tool for organizing these things: ziploc bags.</description>

      <description>When I arrived in Switzerland nine years ago I didn&#39;t speak a word of German (much less Swiss German!), so for a while I faced a very real and practical problem. I would encounter signs on the street, and have absolutely no idea what they meant. Does this sign mean I can pass, or I cannot? &#34;Watch your step&#34; or &#34;Watch for the vicious dog&#34;? During that period, I often wished for a gadget that I could point at the sign and would give me an instant translation.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a cfengine bundle that I wrote for editing the sshd configuration file by passing an array with the parameters. Using an array is a very elegant way of defining the values to set. The bundle also restarts sshd after any changes are made, unless the no_restarts class is defined.
The first gist contains the edit_sshd bundle itself, together with the set_config_values bundle that actually performs the editing job (this should go into a library file, I have it in my personal version of cfengine_stdlib.</description>

The idea behind the video is Pac Man&#39;s final days, free from the maze (kudos if you can guess who&#39;s castle that is) and eating pellets to his heart&#39;s content in a glowing pellet forest. His dead, bloated body is found afterwards and then delivered to 8-Bit Labs.</description>

      <guid>http://zzamboni.org/post/making-cygwin-windows-and-emacs-understand-the-same-symlinks/</guid>
      <description>Today I ran into the problem that symlinks created under cygwin using &#34;ln -s&#34; are not understood by Windows, and of course Windows shortcuts are seen by cygwin as regular files. Happily, this is a (semi-)solved problem. For reference, this is what needs to be done:

 Add &#34;winsymlinks&#34; to your CYGWIN environment variable. For example, in my .bashrc I have the following:
export CYGWIN=&#34;nodosfilewarning winsymlinks&#34;

This makes cygwin create symlinks differently, in a form that is understood both by it and by Windows.</description>

      <description>If you have a human brain, you do this all of the time. Picking out clusters of coincidence is a predictable malfunction of normal human logic. via youarenotsosmart.com  We see patterns everywhere, our brain is hardwired to do it. Most of them are harmless or even beneficial. The problem is when people start assigning meaning to the patterns, as explanation of whatever they want to believe or to convince other people of (such as &#34;</description>

      <guid>http://zzamboni.org/post/cfengine3-lexer-for-pygments/</guid>
      <description>I have written a Cfengine3 lexer for Pygments, the open source syntax-highlighter used by Gist and many other sites. It seems to work fine on all the cfengine policy files I have tested, but if you find anything that doesn&#39;t quite work as expected, please let me know. This is my first-ever Pygments lexer, so if you are an expert and can advise me on better ways of doing things, I&#39;d very much appreciate the feedback too.</description>

      <description>Google has launched a new labs project called Google Scribe, which essentially provides an auto-completion service. You type, it autocompletes. The following text was generated by typing a single space, and from then on simply accepting the default suggestions (pressing &#34;Enter&#34; every time the suggestion popup appeared). I had to stop at some point, but it seems like a good source of mindless entertainment. Also, the result varies depending on the initial seed word you provide, and also on whether you just accept blindly (Enter) or type spaces at certain places.</description>

      <description> via liveleak.com  Scary video (entertaining in a schadenfreude way). I found it unsettling that the &#34;horizon&#34; in the video doesn&#39;t move (as it would in a movie scene, for example, to have you notice how much the boat is moving) since the camera is moving with the ship, but you can infer the violence of the swaying from the damage it caused. /via @benthemorrison on Twitter.

      <description>Effective writers ...
  Separate the writing and the editing processes.   Focus on the interesting.   Tap into the power of metaphor.   Do adequate research.   Learn from the writing of others.   Write in small bursts.   Read their work out loud.    via ragan.com  Worth reading the full article. I particularly suffer from not following #1 - I always end up losing time over editing details, instead of focusing on the raw content of what I&#39;m writing.</description>

      <description>A person&#39;s own name is the single most important word to him/her; it is intimately tied to his/her identity as an individual. How you deal with people&#39;s names can have a profound effect on their impressions of you: Think about the times you&#39;ve felt special when someone you admired addressed you by your name in a sincere tone; or think about the times when you&#39;ve felt belittled when someone negligently called you by the wrong name, or worse, maliciously made fun of your name in front of you.</description>

      <description>I recently posted a snippet to perform hierarchical copying in cfengine3. As I was attempting to integrate this mechanism into my copy of cfengine&#39;s COPBL, I realized that no additional functions or body components are needed. Thanks to cfengine3&#39;s list expansion, all you need to do is include in the existing copy promise the list containing the desired list of suffixes to try. For example:

      <description>Here is a sample implementation in cfengine3 of the technique described in the cfengine wiki as &#34;Singlecopy Nirvana&#34; for cfengine2. Cfengine3 makes the technique more powerful by allowing modularization, so that you can specify both the suffixes to try, and the files to copy using those suffixes, as variables. Also, cf3&#39;s automatic list expansion allows us to write a single copy statement that will be automatically expanded into all the different values to try.</description>

$¬†mkdir -p /usr/local/share/texmf

      <description>Here are 10 big ideas from David Allen‚Äôs Getting Things Done‚Ä¶
1. If your day-to-day life is out of control, it‚Äôs almost impossible to think strategically or plan effectively. 2. Define what being ‚Äúdone‚Äù looks like.
3. Mental work has five distinct phases: Collect, Process, Organize, Do, and Review
4. Get everything out of your head.
5. Projects and tasks are two different things: track them separately.
6. Focus on the Next Action required to move forward.</description>

You try it on, look in the mirror and decide you must have it. While wearing this item, you imagine onlookers will clutch their chests and gasp every time you walk into a room or cross a street. You lift the sleeve to check the price ‚Äì $1,000.
Well, that‚Äôs that, you think.</description>

      <description>of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult. In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening (source: CDC). Drowning does not look like drowning via mariovittone.com  This is an eye-opening article for me. Not having actually watched anyone drown (fortunately), I had the impression that someone drowning would trash madly as shown on TV and movies.</description>

      <description>In their quest to offer a better service every day, the guys at posterous.com have released their Pages tool, which makes it much easier to use Posterous for all my online content by allowing the creation of static pages. And in a stroke of genius, they even allow pages to automatically redirect to arbitrary URLs! This makes it almost trivial to integrate multiple sites into a single, unified user experience. As a first step, as you can see above, I have better integrated this blog and my zznippets¬†blog by giving them a common theme, differentiated only by color.</description>

      <description>It is common in fiction for the bad guys to lose and the good guys to win.
It‚Äôs how you would like to see the world- just and fair.
In psychology, the tendency to believe this is how the real world actually works is called the Just-World Fallacy.
More specifically, this is the tendency to react to horrible misfortune, like homelessness or drug addiction, by believing the people stuck in horrible situations must have done something to deserve it.</description>

      <description>Today I¬†reactivated my Facebook account just to be able to delete it completely. If you find Facebook useful, you should at least be aware of its potential privacy issues, and tune your privacy settings to a level that you find comfortable. Here are some links where you can find more information:

Personally, I don&#39;t find Facebook useful enough to go through the hassle. My account has been deactivated for the last couple of weeks and I haven&#39;t missed it, so now it&#39;s time to permanently delete it.</description>

      <description>via mattmckeon.com  This is a very good analysis, and is why my Facebook account is currently deactivated, and probably will be deleted. Contrary to Matt, I don&#39;t find Facebook very useful. Mostly it&#39;s served me to be found by people by whom I wasn&#39;t all that interested in being found, to see relatives&#39; photos (which I can also receive through other means), to be endlessly spammed by people playing Farmville and, most usefully, to contact people whose email addresses I don&#39;t have or can&#39;t bother to remember.</description>

I get a message saying &#34;your player may need an upgrade&#34;, then the screen goes black, but after about 45 seconds, the DVD menu appears and you can play the movie correctly.
The first time I watched it, the black screen freaked me out, I didn&#39;t wait too long, and ended up watching the movie from the regular DVD.</description>

      <description>Since I started at my new job and moved to a new machine and OS, my old GTD setup has fallen by the wayside and I have found myself at a loss trying to keep track of things. I have found OneNote to be a very useful tool for keeping notes and reference material, and Outlook 2010 is actually not that bad as a task/calendar/email management tool.
¬†So, as a first step, here are some links I have found and which I am in the process of reading and digesting for creating my own setup:</description>

      <description> via queretaro.gob.mx  Queretaro, where I live, is abundant in free WiFi hotspots, they claim they are the Mexican city with the most coverage. In any case, it&#39;s very nice, most parks and public places or government buildings have free Internet access, and in my experience it&#39;s even not too slow.

      <description> Given all this, I predict that later this year the iPad product line will be something like:   $499, 16GB WiFi $599, 32GB 3G $699, 64GB, 3G  Bottom line: If you are on the fence about buying a 1.0 iPad, go with the cheapest model.

      <guid>http://zzamboni.org/post/capturing-multiple-matches-in-ruby/</guid>
      <description>To collect all regex matches in a string into an array, pass the regexp object to the string&#39;s scan() method, e.g.: myarray = mystring.scan(/regex/). Sometimes, it is easier to create a regex to match the delimiters rather than the text you are interested in. In that case, use the split() method instead, e.g.: myarray = mystring.split(/delimiter/). The split() method discards all regex matches, returning the text between the matches. The scan() method does the opposite.</description>

; try to improve slow performance on windows.(setq w32-get-true-file-attributes nil)  It seems this variable was changed to default to &#34;true&#34; relatively recently and is known to cause some slow-down problems around file access. I still get some random hangs now and then (probably due to my .emacs customisations) but it is much better now.</description>

      <description>I want to post a short update aimed at users of my iPhoto plugin CopperExport. I have received multiple reports of it failing in recent updates of Snow Leopard, and I have also verified personally that it does not work properly in iPhoto&#39;09.
Unfortunately, since the big move, I find myself without easy access to a Mac for development (I had a Mac at my previous job, and I use Windows at my new job), which pretty much makes fixing these bugs impossible.</description>

      <description>For a few weeks now, all of mine and my family&#39;s online presence and services have been running exclusively using free services. Before, we shared a rented server with some friends, and that server hosted all the services provided by all of our domains: zzamboni.org, sorianoramirez.org, newmoms.ch and virtsecurity.org. 
Now, with our moving to a different country and all that, we decided to eliminate the need to rent a server, and even reduce costs in the process.</description>

As part of the process to¬†leave Switzerland, my wife and I decided to stop using our own self-managed server (which we have used for over two years,¬†shared with some good friends) and move everything to &#34;the cloud&#34;, using hosted services. This includes mainly email, which we moved to¬†Google Apps, and several web sites and blogs, which turned out to be the complicated bit.</description>

      <description>First off, credit for this fix goes to Geoff Watts from his two tweets.
If you‚Äôre using Snow Leopard, you‚Äôll find that the current version of MacFusion refuses to complete a connection to a remote server. You can fix this in two steps:
First, quit MacFusion.
Second, open System Preferences and then open the MacFUSE pane. Check the ‚ÄúShow Beta Versions‚Äù box and click ‚ÄúCheck For Updates‚Äù. Go ahead and update MacFUSE.</description>

      <description>Posterous now supports even GitHub Gists - they keep adding support for more and more different sites, both for embedding and for auto-posting. I can&#39;t wait to get my iPhone, to use it more and more effectively everywhere.

      <title>How to trick an RHEL5 client install to use server RPMs</title>

      <description>For one of my projects at work, I am using a test install of RHEL5 in &#34;workstation&#34; mode, but I needed to install some packages that are only available in the &#34;server&#34; package list. To temporarily make yum search the server repositories, just change the following line in /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date: 
versionOverride=5Server 
(normally the value is empty). </description>

      <description>After a lot of searching (and trying iMovie) for how to convert a video file to flash (.flv) format, I found¬†ffmpegX, a nice tool that does all the hard work, invoking other tools in the backend as needed. </description>

      <description>I am a big fan of the incredibly useful¬†1Password. The latest beta release (2.8.3.BETA-11)¬†introduces a new keychain format¬†that, among other things, allows 1Password to detect changes made to the file by other programs and reload the changes on the fly. I am using this now to keep my 1P data synchronized between my work and personal accounts on my machine. Here&#39;s what I did:
 In my work account (dza), switch to the AgileKeyChain format by¬†following the instructions.</description>

      <description>Update (2008/09/10): Giles Orr kindly pointed out that he is not the author of the bash prompt package I use, I have updated to give proper credit to the author, Raymond Page.
For some time I have used Raymond Page&#39;s bash prompt code (heavily based on the work by Giles Orr in the Bash Prompt HOWTO, you can get it at http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_Prompt_Magic or http://code.google.com/p/homenix/source/browse/, you need to get .prompt, .prompt_functions and .</description>

      <description>If you have been using my¬†method for defining new wallet items in 1Password, you may have noticed that in recent versions the display of those new items has been broken. I have updated the instructions and the script to work with the recent changes, you can get it from the same page. </description>

      <description>I had noticed for a while that somehow my Mail.app&#39;s &#34;recent mail addresses&#34; list was not updating (I never seemed to get any of my recently used addresses in Quicksilver). Today I noticed the following error message in /var/log/system.log:

      <description>Here&#39;s my mapping from David Allen&#39;s GTD workflow to the parts in my system that implement each component. My main electronic tools are Things (http://culturedcode.com/things/ ), Journler (http://journler.com/ ), Mail.app and iCal. My main physical tools are my HPDA, my physical tickler file, my A-Z filing cabinets and my &#34;inbox&#34; and &#34;pending&#34; boxes.

      <description>Posterous looks quite nice, with the ability to &#34;do the right thing&#34; for different media types, and to autopost to other places. I have just set it up to autopost to my blog (http://zzamboni.org/brt/ ), we&#39;ll see if it does the right thing. 
It should also auto-post to Flickr, so here goes a test photo.
