**Who:** I am a computer scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin,
author and overall geek, now turned project leader and team manager. I
am from Mexico but live in Switzerland with my awesome wife and our
two beautiful daughters.

**What:** I work as the lead of a development team in the Cloud
Platform Division of [Swisscom](http://swisscom.com/), where I am
applying my experience and background in security, configuration
management, cloud computing and automation to build the
next-generation cloud infrastructure for Swisscom and its customers.
I am also the author of ["Learning CFEngine 3"](http://cf-learn.info).

**Where:** I was born in Argentina, but have moved around all my life.
When I was very young I moved to Mexico, where I lived in four different
cities before moving to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D. at [Purdue
University](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) under the direction of [Gene
Spafford](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/). Upon finishing my studies, my
wife and I decided to go to Switzerland, where I worked at the [IBM
Zurich Research Lab](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/). After eight years, we
[moved back to Mexico](/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/index.html) in late
2009.

**Long version:** If you are interested, here's my [curriculum
vitae](/vita.html). For other useless trivia about me, see

### About this site

This entire site is generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and served
by [GitHub](http://github.com/) through the incredibly useful
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) feature.

Both the source and the generated website are stored in the
[zzamboni/zzamboni.org](https://github.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.org) repository,
which is devoted to this content. Some of my [project](/code) pages
are stored in the `gh-pages` branch of their own github
repositories. Since GitHub Pages supports custom domains, all of them
can be transparently hosted under the zzamboni.org domain.

I think it's incredible that all of this infrastructure is so easy to
use and available for free.
