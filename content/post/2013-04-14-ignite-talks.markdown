I'm giving an Ignite talk for the first time at
[DevOps days Paris](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/program/). It's
an interesting format: a 5-minute talk with 20 auto-advancing slides,
every 15 seconds. I found
[How to Give a great Ignite Talk](http://scottberkun.com/2009/how-to-give-a-great-ignite-talk/)
by Scott Berkun very useful, including the accompanying video.
