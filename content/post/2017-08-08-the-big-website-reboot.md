Welcome to the new zzamboni.org.

<!--more-->

Over the years, my website has seen its fair share of transformations,
change and breakage. For a few years now, it had stagnated - me with
not having much time to update, and its accumulated technological
cruft piling high enough to keep me from even touching it, lest I
break something.

So, the time has come to do a reboot. With this post, I'm launching
the new and reinvented [zzamboni.org](http://zzamboni.org/). Through
previous incarnations I had always tried to preserve backwards
compatibility in my URLs so people could still find my old stuff, but
this has become too big a burden. I may add some things under their
old location, and I may add over time some tools to make it easier to
find the old stuff, but in general this won't be a concern and I will
not let it stop me from adding new content.

Over the years, the underlying technologies have changed (Wordpress,
Posterous, Jekyll, Octopress, Enwrite). As a tech guy, I always enjoy
playing with new toys. For now I have settled on using
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a great static-website generator, using its
[Ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme. Hugo
and Ananke are powerful and flexible to satisfy my needs, both current
and future, as far as I can foresee them. The website continues to be
hosted through the fantastic [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

So this is it. ~~For now the site is mostly empty, but new content
will be appearing shortly, both new and ported from my old website.~~
I have started adding posts from my previous blogs. Thanks to Hugo's
`aliases` feature, most of them should be accessible still through
their old URLs.

Please take a look around, and [let me know](/contact) if you find
anything broken.
