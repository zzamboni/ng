I’ve been trying out <a href='http://airmailapp.com'>Airmail</a> as my main email app. It’s quite nice, I like the built-in integrations, particularly with Evernote. By default, when you use the “Save to Evernote” action, it saves the current message to Evernote and opens the newly-created note. I went spelunking into the Airmail application directory, and found the way to disable the note-opening. Follow these steps:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Quit Airmail (don’t know if this is necessary, but it can’t hurt)</li>
<li>Open the Terminal app</li>
<li>Run the following command in the terminal (all in a single line):<br/>
<font face='Andale Mono'>sudo /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript\ Editor.app/Contents/MacOS/AppleScript\ Editor  /Applications/Airmail.app/Contents/Resources/Evernote.applescript<br/></font>This will ask you for your password and then run the AppleScript Editor.<br/>
Note: in my experience, the AppleScript Editor app may open behind the terminal window - look at the Dock for its icon, and bring it to the front.</li>
<li>In the AppleScript Editor window, find this line:<br/>
<font face='Andale Mono'>            open note window with the note<br/></font>and comment it out by inserting a # at the beginning, like this:<br/>
<font face='Andale Mono'>#            open note window with the note</font><br/></li>
<li>Save the modified file and quit AppleScript Editor.</li>
<li>Restart Airmail.</li>
</ol>
<div>That’s it! Now the “Save to Evernote” action saves the current message to Evernote, but does not open it.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
</span>
