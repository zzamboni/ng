For one of my projects at work, I am using a test install of RHEL5 in "workstation" mode, but I needed to install some packages that are only available in the "server" package list. To temporarily make yum search the server repositories, just change the following line in /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date: <p></p>   	versionOverride=5Server <p></p>   (normally the value is empty).
