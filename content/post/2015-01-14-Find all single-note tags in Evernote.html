<div>I’ve been working on cleaning up my Evernote, and noticed that I have a lot of tags assigned to a single note. I had successfully used Veritrope’s excellent <a href='http://veritrope.com/code/evernote-empty-tag-remover/'>Evernote empty tag remover applescript</a>, so I made some small changes to write the attached script, which will find all single-note tags in your Evernote and list them in a new note, including links to each note. This makes it much easier to go through them and see which of those tags could be removed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Just download the script, open it in Script Editor and run it.</div>

<div>Tip of the hat to <a href='http://justinlancy.com'>Justin</a> for his <a href='http://veritrope.com/code_library/'>excellent collection of scripts</a> at Veritrope!</div>
